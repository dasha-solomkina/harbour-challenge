# Harbour Project
This project is part of the Skill Challenge in the application process for the Frontend Apprenticeship Programme. The goal was to build an adapted version of the Programme Template Page, integrating API services, implementing micro-interactions, and managing application state effectively. <br/>
The application follows a modular architecture, with components broken down into small, reusable pieces, and uses Panda CSS for clean and scalable styling. The layout is designed with responsiveness in mind. The layout is responsive for desktop and mobile devices.
